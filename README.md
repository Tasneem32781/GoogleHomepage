I want to start learning basic HTML and CSS from scratch (lol, I feel so cool doing that), instead of relying on AI like most people do for CSS.
I’ve already done some digging into
1 . Flexbox
2 . positioning
3 . padding, etc., so I know a little bit about them. I just want to get better at everything.
